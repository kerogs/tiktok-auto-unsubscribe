# Tiktok auto unsubscribe

I had no problems using it. The script removed all my subscriptions on the first try (204 follows).

I don't know if this one will work for you. In any case, if it doesn't, let me know and I'll try to correct the problem.

## How to use
1. First, launch tiktok from a browser and log in.

2. Then go to your profile and click on the button for the number of people you follow.

3. When the Followers page opens, scroll down as far as you can. This is necessary to load all the people you are following.

4. Then right-click on the page and click on “inspect” and click on "console" button. You can also press ``CTRL + SHIT + i`` to open it

5. Copy the code from the ``unsubscribe.js`` file and paste it into the console

6. And you can send the code. by pressing enter

## Information
- Don't close the page while the work is in progress.
